      ELC start of season 2022-23
    </h2>

      The Early Years Development Center "Urban Kids" has opened its doors for vulnerable families in
      Chisinau and its suburbs. From 5 to 9 September 2022, a series of opening lessons were held for
      70 mothers and their 85 children, during which parents and children plunged into the atmosphere
      of learning and new discoveries that await them in the new season 2022-23. The special concept
      of parent-child integral education, piloted for many years, allows not only to create a strong
      bond in family relationships, but also to get to know each other much deeper and better, and to
      develop a whole set of skills and abilities necessary for subsequent schooling.
      The new season is unique as it is included in the large educational project "Building Resilience
      in Vulnerable Communities 22-25" in which the model of integrated early childhood development
      will be thoroughly tested and studied on a number of levels and measurements. This project is
      carried out in close cooperation with partners from the UK and Bulgaria.
